Checkout all files, use Inno Setip to open one of the .iss file,
you should be able to "compile" right away without any difficulty.

To develop your own version, create a "latest" folder/directory under tags
instead of a "trunk" folder/directory at the root. DO NOT COMMIT latest without
renaming.

Note: You are responsible to change the Support URLs if you want to distribute
your modified file.
